This project is a fork of the official Profiler4j project by Antonio S. R. Gomes.
You can find it at sourceforge: `http://profiler4j.sourceforge.net/`_

I've created this fork to add one or two features, such as:

- save/load functionality for snapshots
- exporting the call graph as a picture
- allowing to have each snapshot dumped to disk automatically, which helps when profiling many small pieces of a workflow
- ...

Maybe I'll even implement some of those goals.
