This project is a fork of the official Profiler4j project by Antonio S. R. Gomes.
You can find it at sourceforge: http://profiler4j.sourceforge.net/

I've created this fork to add one or two features. They have been added and this project is done. For full documentation, see the `project's page <http://jmc7479.github.com/profiler4j/>`_ at github.

For the sources to the documentation, check out the "gh-pages" branch.
