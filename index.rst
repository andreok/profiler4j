Profiler4j Fork
===============

Profiler4j Fork is, intuitively clear, a fork of the `original Profiler4j <http://profiler4j.sourceforge.net/>`_. I've begun it to enhance the already very useful and handy tool at some points.

The project is now finished, since all issues, which I wanted to add, have been added. For more information, please see the documentation below.

As the original project, the fork is available under a `APACHE LICENSE v2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt>`_
