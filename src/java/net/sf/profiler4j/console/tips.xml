<![CDATA[<h1>Improve your Profiling Session</h1>
Define profiling rules <b>as restrictive as possible</b> as this can improve the accuracy of
your measurements and impose less overhead. As a simple rule of thumb, leave only those
ACCEPT rules that refer to your application classes and, at the end of the list, put a 
REJECT on <tt>*(*)</tt>.
<p>
Remember that you can always change your mind and write new rules that can be 
<b>activated without restarting</b> your application.
